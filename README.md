## Prerequisites

- a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/ES6
- the fundamentals of React

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 6 and npm >= 5.2 on your machine. 
- To create a project, run:
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
   This runs the app in the development mode.  
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
   
   The page will reload if you make edits.  
   You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Goals

We'll make a simple CRUD app. It will have users, and you'll be able to add, update, or delete users. Instead of using React classes, we'll utilize State Hooks and Effect Hooks on functional components.
